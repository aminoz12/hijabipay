### 4.2 Edit the .env file:

Open the `.env` file in a text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.) and configure:

```env
# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-random-key-here-generate-something-long

# PayPal Configuration (REQUIRED)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your-paypal-client-id-here
PAYPAL_SECRET=your-paypal-secret-here
PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

2. Log in or create a developer account (it's free)
3. Go to **Dashboard** â†’ **My Apps & Credentials**
4. Under "Sandbox", click **"Create App"**

python update_db.py
```

This creates the SQLite database with all necessary tables.

```powershell
python app.py
```

You should see:

```
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "python is not recognized"
**Solution:** You need to install Python and make sure "Add to PATH" is checked during installation.

### Problem: "pip is not recognized"
**Solution:** Same as above - reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked.

### Problem: "npm is not recognized"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/

### Problem: "cannot activate venv"
**Solution:** Try this command instead:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then try activating again:
```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Problem: PayPal credentials error
**Solution:** Make sure you've:
1. Created a PayPal developer account
2. Created an app in the sandbox
3. Copied the correct Client ID and Secret to `.env`
4. Set `PAYPAL_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox` in `.env`

### Problem: Database errors
**Solution:** Delete the database and recreate:
```powershell
Remove-Item instance\payments.db -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
python update_db.py
```
